> [!TIP]
> Like the DOS-DOS(https://github.com/manas0403GitHub/DOS-DOS), it is a mulit-command line project(with my projects) but, for Powershell.

### The projects are:
### -> HANG(Hangman)
### -> RIDD(Riddler)
### -> PASS(Passworder)

## Game 1: Hangman
### You can find this game at 'https://github.com/manas0403GitHub/Hangman'.

### Start the Game: 
  - Once you have the game open, youâ€™ll typically see a blank space for the word or phrase you need to guess, along with a virtual keyboard to select letters.
### Guess Letters: 
  - Click on the letters you want to guess.
  - If the letter is in the word, it will appear in the correct position(s); if not, part of the hangman will be drawn.
  > [!NOTE]
  >   - The letter will not be the same as the word.
  >   - And, there can be a other letter that you didn't type. 
### Win or Lose: 
  - The goal is to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
  - If you guess the word correctly, you win; if the hangman is completed first, you lose.


## Game 2: Riddler

### Riddler is a question game. You need to answer the question correct.

## Game 3: Passworder
